Computer Architecture - Implementation of Single Cycle Processor
----------------------
Tiffany Yu

This code is for a single cycle processor implemented in Verilog. The processor file is the main control of the processer.
The ALU file contains the ALU used within the processor. 

Instructions on use:
1. Convert desired code into MIPS assembly code
2. Convert MIPS assembly code to binary instructions
3. Save desired constants in memory
4. Save series of instructions in instruction memory
