Computer Architecture - Implementation of Single Cycle Processor
----------------------
Written by: Tiffany Yu

This code is for a single cycle processor implemented in Verilog using the program ISE Design Suite. The processor file is the main control of the processer.
The ALU file contains the ALU used within the processor. 

Instructions on use:
1. Convert desired code into MIPS assembly code
2. Convert MIPS assembly code to binary instructions
3. Save desired constants in memory
4. Save series of instructions in instruction memory
